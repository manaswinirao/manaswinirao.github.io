excerpt: 'We evaluate the effect of incentives for clean milk production among dairy cooperatives in rural India. In a randomized evaluation, we vary both the application of incentives as well as managers ability to control information about payments. Incentives improve cleanliness on average, but some managers choose to decline payment when they cannot control information disclosure. Opting out of payment is more frequent among managers with lower social status. We present a model of information and elite capture that highlights this trade-off between productive efficiency and distribution of rents where, in some cases, strengthening elite power can be Pareto improving. <span style="color:blue">[Link to AEA Trial Registry.](https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/700)</span>'
