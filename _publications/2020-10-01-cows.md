excerpt: 'We study how the mechanism of payment delivery affects the potential for collective action in rural Indian villages. To do so, we implement a randomized evaluation of a group-level incentive payment for lower bacteria count among village dairy cooperatives in Karnataka. The incentive structure tests whether cooperative members and management can sufficiently leverage local information and peer monitoring mechanisms to deliver a cleaner bulk product. We further vary whether incentive payments are announced publicly to cooperative members or revealed privately to cooperative management alone. Results show that group incentives are sufficient to improve production quality in village cooperatives, but that this result is sensitive to the way in which incentives are administered. When faced with the prospect of public announcement, managers in a third of cooperatives opt out of receiving incentive payments entirely, undermining any possible incentive effect. Dropout is concentrated among cooperatives with weaker management oversight. <span style="color:blue">[Link to AEA Trial Registry.](https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/700)</span>'
