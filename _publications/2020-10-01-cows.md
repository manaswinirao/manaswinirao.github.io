excerpt: 'Much smallholder production in developing countries takes place in groups that enforce production norms and mediate internal allocation of surplus. We evaluate incentive contracts for quality upgrading among such production teams. In a randomized experiment with rural Indian
dairy cooperatives, we find group incentives improve aggregate quality even when individual
quality cannot be traced, with evidence of increased effort from both producers and managers.
However, several cooperative managers decline incentive payments when local elites cannot
control payment-related information disclosure. Survey evidence suggests disclosure introduces
frictions, implying that some efforts to limit elite capture may undermine broader development
goals. <span style="color:blue">[Link to AEA Trial Registry.](https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/700)</span>'
