excerpt: 'We implement a randomized evaluation to pay for lower bacteria count among cooperative
dairy producers in rural Karnataka. Incentives for cleaner milk are applied at a group level and
paid into a shared cooperative bank account. We further vary whether incentive payments are
announced publicly to cooperative members or revealed privately to cooperative management
alone. Results show that group incentives are sufficient to improve production quality in village
cooperatives. However, this result is sensitive to the way in which incentives are administered.
When faced with the prospect of public announcement, managers in a third of cooperatives opt
out of receiving incentive payments entirely, undermining any possible incentive effect. Dropout
is most common among cooperatives with weaker management oversight. We argue that the
decision to opt out only in the face of publicly announced incentives seems inconsistent with the
Coase Theroem and other simple models of joint utility maximization. <span style="color:blue">[Link to AEA Trial Registry.](https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/700)</span>'
