excerpt: 'We examine the effect of caste identity of village council leaders in India on the choice of local policies using the quasi-random assignment of the leaders’ position quota to specific caste groups within sub-districts. Overall, we find weak redistributive effects suggesting that choice of policies may only be a small component of the politician’s objective function even at the lowest tiers of the political structure.'
