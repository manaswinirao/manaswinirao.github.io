excerpt: 'Strong legal institutions are considered important for economic growth, of which ordinary trial courts are a key component. In the context of India, I examine the role of such courts on firms' performance by exploiting microdata on trials and a policy inducing quasi-random variation in judge vacancies. Overall, local firms expand production and earn higher profits when vacancy is lower. Lower vacancy increases trial resolution in courts, which stimulates bank lending through improved liquidity from debt recoveries. As a result, firms experience an increase in credit access, expanding output and profitability, generating an 8:1 benefit to cost ratio.
