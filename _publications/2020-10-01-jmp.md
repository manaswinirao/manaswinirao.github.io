excerpt: "How does local judicial capacity affect firm behavior? I provide an answer to this question using the universe of litigation data between 2010 and 2018, amounting to 6 million trial records from over a quarter of all district courts in India. I exploit the plausibly random timing of judge additions and removals that affect the total number of judges available in a given court-year to causally examine the effect of judicial capacity constraints on local firms using multiple event studies research design. I find that adding a judge increases local firms' factor-use and value of production, driven by an improvement in the rate of trial resolution in district courts and credit access to industrial borrowers. The results imply that reducing vacancy by hiring more judges will generate orders of magnitude larger benefit relative to its cost.
