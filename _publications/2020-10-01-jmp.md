excerpt: 'How do legal institutions, such as sub-national courts, impact economic growth? I examine the effect of trial court capacity on local firms performance by exploiting quasi-random variation in judge vacancies and mapping trial records for a third of such courts in India with court-level performance measures, bank lending, and firm outcomes. How does local judicial capacity affect firm behavior? I provide an answer to this question using the universe of litigation data between 2010 and 2018, amounting to 6 million trial records from over a quarter of all district courts in India.
