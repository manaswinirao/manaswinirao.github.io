excerpt: 'How do legal institutions, such as sub-national courts, impact economic growth? I examine the effect of trial court capacity on local firms performance by exploiting quasi-random variation in judge vacancies and mapping trial records for a third of such courts in India with court-level performance measures, bank lending, and firm outcomes. Utilizing the fact that timely trial resolution helps free tied-up capital in debt recovery litigation, I find that reducing judge vacancy increases local firms production and profitability through improved access to bank credit. Addressing judge vacancy would generate at least 12:1 benefit-cost ratio. Test test test
