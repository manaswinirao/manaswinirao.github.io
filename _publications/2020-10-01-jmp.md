excerpt: 'Courts are considered as an important institution in the functioning of markets. Yet, there is limited causal evidence showing this relationship. This paper estimates the causal effects of court output on formal sector firm production using novel data comprising of the universe of 6 million case records over 9 years across 195 district courts in India. Taking advantage of the granular data, I construct a robust measure of court output, both at the level of the district court as well as at the level of caseload involving specific firms that I am able to match with a sample dataset on firms. These measurements enable me to shed light on the role of court output on lending behavior in local credit markets, which responds positively to an increase in court output. This is because timely resolution of litigation supports lenders and acts as a deterrent to non-financial firms. As a result, this relaxes the credit constraints firms face, expanding production and improving profits. To demonstrate these effects as causal, I exploit plausible exogenous variation in judge occupancy, arising out of a system of rotating transfers of judges and existing vacancies, to instrument for potentially endogenous court output. Finally, I show positive complementarities between better courts output and legal reforms by using the examples of industrial-labor relations and changes in bankruptcy procedure.'
