excerpt: 'Front-line courts handle the bulk of legal cases and yet they are severely under-resourced, with potential implications for economic development. Using rich court-level panel data from India, constructed using the universe of legal case records, and an event study research design, I show that an increase in judge staffing levels substantially reduces case backlog in district courts, and subsequently improves the productivity of local formal sector firms. One of the key mechanisms driving these effects is the last mile enforcement of credit contracts, which enables banks to lend more to the industrial sector. Hiring district judges is highly cost-effective.
