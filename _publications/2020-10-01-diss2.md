excerpt: 'The efficacy of bankruptcy reforms in strengthening lender rights and credit markets often depends on local enforcement capacity through courts. We analyze India's national bankruptcy reform in 2016 using a triple difference research design, exploiting variation in baseline district-level judge-to-population ratios and firm-level default risk or capital efficiency (marginal revenue product of capital or MRPK). The reform reduced borrowing by high-default-risk firms but did not increase borrowing by high MRPK firms in districts with better judicial capacity relative to those with worse capacity. Consistent with these results, we find negative economic effects among high-default-risk firms and limited positive effects among high MRPK firms, suggesting that such reforms fall short of achieving allocative efficiency.'
