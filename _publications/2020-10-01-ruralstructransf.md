excerpt: 'A large and primarily theoretical literature explores how wealth inequality interacts with financial frictions in the process of economic growth, with limited attention to landholding distributions. In this paper, we highlight key facts about rural landholding inequality and local structural transformation, and demonstrate the macroeconomic consequences using a dynamic heterogeneous agent model that features frictions in both land and credit markets. We show that these interacting frictions limit the ability of rural landholders to engage in higher productivity irrigated agriculture and non-agricultural entrepreneurship that enable structural transformation. We provide evidence that the distribution of land ownership can systematically determine which localities can productively cultivate land and utilize wealth generated thus for financing non-agricultural enterprises in the long-run.'
